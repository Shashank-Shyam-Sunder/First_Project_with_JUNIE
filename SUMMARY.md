3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added information about the batch files to the README.md

### Application Structure

- `main.py`: The main FastAPI application with all endpoints
- `models.py`: Pydantic models for the application
- `run_server.py`: Script to run the application with uvicorn
- `test_api.py`: Tests for all API endpoints
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies
- `run_app.bat`: Batch file to run the application on Windows
- `run_tests.bat`: Batch file to run the tests on Windows

## Frontend Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Created Frontend Structure**
   - Created a `/frontend` folder with all necessary files
   - Implemented a responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no UI libraries)
   - Added comprehensive documentation in README.md

2. **Implemented Features**
   - Interactive quiz interface with multiple screens
   - API integration for fetching questions and submitting answers
   - Real-time feedback and score tracking
   - Responsive design for all device sizes

### Frontend Structure

- `/frontend/index.html`: Main entry point for the application
- `/frontend/css/styles.css`: Styling for the application
- `/frontend/js/api.js`: API service for backend communication
- `/frontend/js/app.js`: Main application logic
- `/frontend/README.md`: Documentation for the frontend

## How to Run the Application

### Backend API

1. Make sure you're in the project directory
2. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated)
3. Run the application using one of these methods:
   - `python run_server.py`
   - `run_app.bat` (on Windows)
   - `uvicorn main:app --reload`

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000 with documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Frontend Interface

1. Make sure the backend API is running (follow the steps above)
2. Open the frontend application using one of these methods:
   - Double-click on the `frontend/index.html` file
   - Open the file in your browser via File > Open menu
   - Or serve the files using a simple HTTP server

The frontend will connect to the API at http://localhost:8000 automatically

## How to Test the Application

1. Start the application using one of the methods above
2. In a separate terminal, run the tests using one of these methods:
   - `python test_api.py`
   - `run_tests.bat` (on Windows)

The tests will verify that all endpoints are working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Check that the virtual environment is activated
3. Verify that no other application is using port 8000
4. Check the console for any error messages
